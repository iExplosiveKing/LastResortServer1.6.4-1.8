### How to add a world
To add a world, go to the "worldsaves" folder in the repository.
Next, select any folder that has a number. Then create a file named: "saveLog.md"

Then, enter this in it:

* **World Save Info**
* **Name: <your world's name here>**

* **Theme: <your world's theme>**

* **What you want added to it is: <what you want to be added in it>**

* **Your Gamertag: <your gamertag>**


Now save it in the repository.  



Doing this means together we can easily add updates as a team.
